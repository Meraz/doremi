=== Warning
This game has unfortunately only been tested on Windows 10.

=== Startup instructions
This copy of the game has been prepared to run independant and locally without the use of any Internet connection. This can be changed and is explained in greter detail below.
To simply run a complete setup of the game with the current configuration simply execute "Run.bat". Running "Run.bat" should take care of everything.
For more advanced use, the client can be started independantly via "Client.exe", the server from "Server.exe", and a master server can be started locally via "Master.exe".

=== Configuration
It is possible to change some configurations to fit the current situation by changing fields within the file "/ConfigurationFiles/Configuration.txt", we refer to this file as the 'Configuration file'.
If the configuration file has not been modified since since installment it should have the neccessary configurations for a complete local experience.

To change where one expects to find a master server running, simply open the configuration file and locate the following field "IPToMaster xx.xx.xx.xx".
Change it to "IPToMaster 127.0.0.1" if you expect to find a master server at 127.0.0.1.

=== Objective
